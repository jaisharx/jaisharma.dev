## Getting started

I've build this using the latest and greatest [Nextjs]() framework of react.
It really helps you with pain point of building an app with react.

You can close and run the website locally:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
